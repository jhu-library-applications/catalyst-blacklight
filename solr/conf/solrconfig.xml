    JHU: We set properties enable.master and enable.searcher in solr.xml for
    this core. Master has replication master, and no warming queries. searcher
    has replication slave and warming queries. Maybe other differences in the
    future. You could set both to true to get both behaviors.

                  another process trying to modify the index.
         native = NativeFSLockFactory - uses OS native file locking.
                  Do not use when multiple solr webapps in the same
                  JVM are attempting to share a single index.
         simple = SimpleFSLockFactory  - uses a plain file for locking

         Defaults: 'native' is default for Solr3.6 and later, otherwise
                   'simple' is the default

         Perform a hard commit automatically under certain conditions.
         Instead of enabling autoCommit, consider using "commitWithin"
         when adding documents.

         http://wiki.apache.org/solr/UpdateXmlMessages

         maxDocs - Maximum number of documents to add since the last
                   commit before automatically triggering a new commit.

         maxTime - Maximum amount of time in ms that is allowed to pass
                   since a document was added before automatically
                   triggering a new commit.
         openSearcher - if false, the commit causes recent index changes
           to be flushed to stable storage, but does not cause a new
           searcher to be opened to make those changes visible.

         If the updateLog is enabled, then it's highly recommended to
         have some sort of hard autoCommit to limit the log size.

   <!--
    An analysis handler that provides a breakdown of the analysis process of provided docuemnts. This handler expects a
    (single) content stream with the following format:

    <docs>
      <doc>
        <field name="id">1</field>
        <field name="name">The Name</field>
        <field name="text">The Text Value</field>
      <doc>
      <doc>...</doc>
      <doc>...</doc>
      ...
    </docs>

    Note: Each document must contain a field which serves as the unique key. This key is used in the returned
    response to assoicate an analysis breakdown to the analyzed document.
    Like the FieldAnalysisRequestHandler, this handler also supports query analysis by
    sending either an "analysis.query" or "q" request paraemter that holds the query text to be analyized. It also
    supports the "analysis.showmatch" parameter which when set to true, all field tokens that match the query
    tokens will be marked as a "match".

    RequestHandler that provides much the same functionality as analysis.jsp. Provides the ability
    to specify multiple field types and field names in the same request and outputs index-time and
    query-time analysis for each of them.

    Request parameters are:
    analysis.fieldname - The field name whose analyzers are to be used
    analysis.fieldtype - The field type whose analyzers are to be used
    analysis.fieldvalue - The text for index-time analysis
    q (or analysis.q) - The text for query time analysis
    analysis.showmatch (true|false) - When set to true and when query analysis is performed, the produced
                                      tokens of the field value analysis will be marked as "matched" for every
                                      token that is produces by the query analysis
